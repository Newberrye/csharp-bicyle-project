# csharp-bicyle-project
This is my C# 10/NET 6.0 bicycle project for C# Fundamentals from WSUtech.

## Project Summary
Object Oriented Programming skills are used to turn a business plan (see [ACME_Bicycle_Business_Proposal](/ACME_Bicycle_Company_Proposal.pdf "Business Plan") for details) into a functional program. First the business proposal was transferred over to a specification sheet ([see here](/Bicycle_Plan.pdf "Specification Sheet")) and then a design sheet ([see here](/Project_CSharp_Base_Design.pdf "Design Sheet")) was made to layout program development. Next the program was created following the design sheet and a test inventory was made to test program functionality.
